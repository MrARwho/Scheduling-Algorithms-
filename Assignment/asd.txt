if : (arrival time  + bursttime) of p1  > arrival time of p2
    compare p2 bt < p1:
        remaining time = p1(bt)-(currenttime-start)

        queue = [[id,reamingtime]
        sort this queue (everytime a process enters)

        process wali array mn change hoga
        process will repeat with changed BT

        if : (arrival time  + bursttime) of p1  > arrival time of p2
            compare p2 bt < p1:
                remaining time = p1(bt)-(currenttime-start)
                bt = remaining time (update it in the processess array)
